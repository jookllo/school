# School
## Basic Project
The important files are in the dist folder. This contain all of the scripts used for the project. The project is divided into admin, student and teacher. The admin adds users into the system who are the teachers and the students.
### Student panel
The student folder contains all of the scripts for the student panel. This allows for them to see which lesson that they had attended and also be able to print out an attendance sheet into Excel format.
### Teacher panel
The teacher panel allows for them to be able to see which subjects they teach and also register students using an external fingerprint machine. 
### Misc.
The database is called school and is at the root of the folder. Give the import sql file the name school so as to avoid problems.
